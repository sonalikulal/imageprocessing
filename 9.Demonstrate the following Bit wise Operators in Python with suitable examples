# Python program to show
# bitwise operators

a = 10
b = 4

# Print bitwise AND operation
print("a & b =", a & b)

# Print bitwise OR operation
print("a | b =", a | b)

# Print bitwise NOT operation
print("~a =", ~a)

# print bitwise XOR operation
print("a ^ b =", a ^ b)

OUTPUT:
a & b = 0
a | b = 14
~a = -11
a ^ b = 14

LOGICAL OPERATOR
AND
x = 10
y = 20
# Output: x and y is True 
print('x and y is',x and y)

OUTPUT:
x and y is 20

OR
x = 10
y = 20
# Output: x or y is True
print('x or y is',x or y)

OUTPUT:
x or y is 10

NOT
x = 10
y = 20
# Output: not x is False
print('not x is',not x)

OUTPUT:
not x is False

TERNARY OPERATOR
a, b = 10, 20
 
# Copy value of a in min if a < b else copy b
min = a if a < b else b
 
print(min)

OUTPUT:
10

ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
a = 3
b = 5
  
c = a + b
  
# Output
print(c)

OUTPUT:
8
