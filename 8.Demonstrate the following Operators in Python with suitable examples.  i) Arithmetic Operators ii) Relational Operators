Arithmetic
a = 7
b = 2

# addition
print ('Sum: ', a + b)  

# subtraction
print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   

# multiplication
print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  

# division
print ('Division: ', a / b) 

# floor division
print ('Floor Division: ', a // b)

# modulo
print ('Modulo: ', a % b)  

# a to the power b
print ('Power: ', a ** b)

OUTPUT:
Sum:  9
Subtraction:  5
Multiplication:  14
Division:  3.5
Floor Division:  3
Modulo:  1
Power:  49


relational
a = 5

# equal to operator
print('a == b =', a == b)

# not equal to operator
print('a != b =', a != b)

# greater than operator
print('a > b =', a > b)

# less than operator
print('a < b =', a < b)

# greater than or equal to operator
print('a >= b =', a >= b)

# less than or equal to operator
print('a <= b =', a <= b)

OUTPUT:
